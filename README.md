For my open-source business model, I chose to do an open-source cooking recipe database that considers what ingredients a user has in their pantry, and recommends them a dish to cook based on available ingredients. The application can also be further improved to automatically scan receipts to add ingredients automatically and calculate the expiration date of items to prioritize using them first over other longer lasting ingredients. Profits can be made through the implementation of advertisements and an optional user subscription service that can be bought to grant access to more features for the subscriber. For this business model, I would choose the GNU GPLv3 license, as the ability for others to distribute closed source versions could prove harmful against my own business model in the future, especially as I will be attempting to make a profit off this software.
